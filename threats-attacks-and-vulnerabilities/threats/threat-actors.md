# Threat Actors

Throughout your career, leadership will ask you to communicate the probability and impact of something bad happening on the network \(i.e. an incident\). Your success in doing so will largely depend on if you can accurately describe Threat Actors using their attributes and types.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Threat Actors** 

Threat Actors are people who want to exploit the security flaws in your organization.

## Attributes

Attributes are what set people apart. For example, consider the following: reasons why someone might become a cybersecurity professional, what kind of organization they might dream of joining, how much support they have, and the effectiveness of their skills. Maybe they think it's cool and that it can become a high-paying job. What if they want to share in the identity that comes from a globally recognized cybersecurity company? Maybe they have only the laptop they bought at Walmart to work with instead of an Apple Macbook. Finally, what about being incredibly capable versus knowing enough to show-off? These are the same attributes we must use to distinguish one Threat Actor from another. 

### Motivation & Intent 

Threat Actors are motivated by fame, politics, revenge, competition, money, or national security. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Semantics**  
In my mind, I like to discern between the words Motivation and Intent. To me, Motivation represents what causes you to get off the couch. Intent represents where you plan to go. For example, you might be motivated to get up because you're hungry. Yet, your intent \(goal\) is to get a sandwich. I highly doubt CompTIA will ever expect you to make this distinction but this helps me in the way I think about a Threat Actor's "why, reason, etc." So maybe it'll help you. 
{% endhint %}

### Internal vs External

Threat Actors are oriented as either inside or outside of your organization. This attribute is important because people "on the inside" will the knowledge necessary to cause the greatest damage. Imagine someone who is expected to have administrator access versus a stranger. Your security operations might be focused on finding the abnormality yet, what if the source of an incident is the very person investigating it? 

### Resources & Funding

Threat Actors need equipment and the means to sustain their operations. Knowing or understanding these details about an adversary will allow you to gauge the duration/effect of the attack they planned. It will also help leadership decide which risk mitigation strategy they want to invoke. If it's a short-term attack by a Threat Actor with limited resources, you might recommend something superficial to mitigate it \(ex: new firewall rule blocking the source IP address of the attack\). Yet, if the organization falls victim to the corporate espionage you might recommend something significant like revamping the entire employee on-boarding and off-boarding process. 

### Level of Sophistication

The word _sophistication_ means "not simple" and can be used as a spectrum to describe how creative and capable Threat Actors are. For example, a very sophisticated Threat Actor might spend months performing online and in-person reconnaissance against their target before striking. Meanwhile, the kid next door to the same Threat Actor might randomly execute code they found on social media. They don't know exactly what it'll do, but they're interested because it looks like something Elliot Alderson does. 

{% hint style="info" %}
If you've never heard of Elliot Alderson, do a web search for the television show "Mr. Robot." There's also a French hacker of the same pseudo name on Twitter who specializes in Application Security. He goes by the handle "fs0c131y."

## Types

Think of Attributes like ingredients and Types as food. What I explained above goes into every Threat Actor. The terms below represent the different kinds of Threat Actors you will encounter.
