# Threat Actors

Throughout your career, leadership will ask you to communicate the probability and impact of something bad happening on the network \(i.e. an incident\). Your success in doing so will largely depend on if you can accurately describe Threat Actors using their attributes and types.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Threat Actors** 

Threat Actors are people who want to exploit the security flaws in your organization.

## Attributes

Attributes are what set people apart. For example, think about why someone might become a cybersecurity professional, what organization they might dream of joining, how much support they have, and how effective they are at their job. Maybe they think it's cool and that it can become a high-paying job. What if they want to share in the identity that comes from a globally recognized cybersecurity company? Maybe they have only the laptop they bought at Walmart to work with instead of an Apple Macbook. Finally, what about being incredibly capable versus knowing enough to show-off? These are the same attributes we must use to distinguish one Threat Actor from another. 

### Motivation & Intent 

Threat Actors are motivated by fame, politics, revenge, competition, money, or national security.

**Semantics**  
In my mind, I like to discern between the words Motivation and Intent. To me, Motivation represents what causes you to get off the couch. Intent represents where you plan to go. For example, you might be motivated to get up because you're hungry. Yet, your intent \(goal\) is to get a sandwich. I highly doubt CompTIA will ever expect you to make this distinction but this helps me in the way I think about a Threat Actor's "why, reason, etc." So maybe it'll help you.

### Internal vs External

Threat Actors are oriented as either inside or outside of your organization. 

### Resources & Funding

Threat Actors need equipment and the means to sustain their operations. 

### Level of Sophistication

The word _sophistication_ means "not simple" and can be used as a spectrum to describe how creative and capable Threat Actors are. For example, a very sophisticated adversary might spend months performing online and in-person reconnaissance against their target before striking. Meanwhile, the kid next door to the same adversary might randomly execute code they found on social media. They don't know exactly what it'll do, but they're interested because it looks like something Elliot Alderson does. The adversary has a high level of sophistication because of their original skill-set while the kid does not.
