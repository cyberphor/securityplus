# Vulnerability Research

As a cybersecurity professional, it is important to routinely conduct research into the conditions or security flaws that enable threat actors to achieve their objectives. At a high-level, these _vulnerabilities_ can be organized as business processes, system design, misconfigurations, and architecture design. Although, I prefer to use Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\), system design, system misconfigurations, and network defensibility.

## Standard Operating Procedures

Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\) contain administrative security controls and provide instruction on for what should be routine work. For example, the impact of having untrained users, undocumented assets, and poor key management are all signs the organization either does not have, follow, or enforce an SOP. If they did, the risk of the scenarios mentioned would not be a source of vulnerability. 

### Untrained Users

Untrained Users are people who are unaware of the cybersecurity responsibilities they have within the organization. Their ignorance is all that stands between a determined Threat Actor and the next billion dollar data breach. Before granting anyone network access, ensure they have the correct security clearance, need-to-know, signed an Acceptable Use Policy \(AUP\), signed a Non-Disclosure Agreement \(NDA\), and has completed your organization's cybersecurity awareness training. As we will discuss in the "Social Engineering" section, if you want to positively influence someone's behavior, you have to increase their awareness and communicate what is acceptable/unacceptable. 

### Undocumented Assets

You must understand what you have in order to protect it. Undocumented Assets are systems that were added to the network and were either forgotten about at some point or never inventoried. They are your organization's blind-spots. It's like being a home owner. How can you protect your family if you don't know how many doors you need to lock at night?

### Improper Key Management

As a cybersecurity professional, you must ensure keys are properly created, shared, used, stored, and disposed. When we say "keys" we really mean anything that provides access. This includes physical keys, RFID badges, smart cards, PINs, passwords, digital certificates, and safe combinations. I discuss attacks against RFID systems in the "Wireless Communications" section.

## System Design

### Improper Input Handling

### Race Conditions

### Zero-Days

Zero-Days are vulnerabilities that do not have a patch yet. The name alludes to the number of days the software/hardware developer has had to address it.

### Improper Error Handling

### Memory/Buffer Vulnerabilities

### Resource Exhaustion

## System Misconfigurations

### Default Configurations

### Accounts

### Cipher Suites

## Network Defensibility
