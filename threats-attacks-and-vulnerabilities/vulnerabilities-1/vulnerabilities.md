# Vulnerability Research

As a cybersecurity professional, it is important to routinely conduct research into the conditions or security flaws enable threat actors to achieve their objectives. At a high-level, these _vulnerabilities_ can be organized as business processes, system design, misconfigurations, and architecture design. I prefer to use Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\), system design, system misconfigurations, and network defensibility though. 

{% hint style="info" %}
**Vulnerabilities** are conditions or security flaws that enable threat actors to achieve their objectives.
{% endhint %}

## Standard Operating Procedures

### Untrained Users

### Undocumented Assets

### Improper Key Management

## System Design

### Improper Input Handling

### Race Conditions

### Zero-Days

Zero-Days are vulnerabilities that do not have a patch yet. The name alludes to the number of days the software/hardware developer has had to address it.

### Improper Error Handling

### Memory/Buffer Vulnerabilities

### Resource Exhaustion

## System Misconfigurations

### Default Configurations

### Accounts

### Cipher Suites

## Network Defensibility
