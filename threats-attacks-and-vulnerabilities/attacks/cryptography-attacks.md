# Password Guessing

There's no such thing as password cracking. Either the attacker correctly guesses your password or they're able to uncover it. Password guessing include Brute Force, Dictionary, and Hybrid attacks. Each represents how much the attacker is willing to invest in performing reconnaissance beforehand. Regardless, their success depends on if their guessing efforts are online or offline. 

## Online vs Offline Guessing

Online password guessing is noisy and risky for the attacker. If the right cybersecurity controls are in place, the victim should be tipped off relatively quickly. Example controls include having a password lockout policy and multi-factor authentication. Offline guessing is only possible if the attacker is able to access and exfiltrate the database containing username and passwords.
