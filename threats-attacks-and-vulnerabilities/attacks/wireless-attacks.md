# Wireless Communications

In this section, I cover wireless communication and how attackers use this medium to achieve their objectives. 

## Amplification

To remain undetected, attackers will try to stay as far away from their target as possible. In the real-world, this would look like someone using binoculars. In cyberspace, this is someone beefing-up their hacking rig to include a high-powered antenna that can reach greater distances than the one that came with their laptop or cellphone.

## Interference

Interference is when a transmitter and receiver are unable to wirelessly communicate with each other. When Interference is intentional, it's considered Jamming. 

### Jamming

Attackers are often successful in Jamming wireless communications when they're able to get their equipment to transmit a high-powered signal on the same frequency as their target. If the attacker's signal is able to cancel out their victim's, they have effectively achieved a Denial-of-Service \(DoS\) attack. 

### Disassociation

A Disassociation attack is a 

## Rogue APs

Attackers use Rogue APs \(Access Points\) in order to wirelessly extend the already-existing, wired network. The benefit of doing so allows them to bypass various network access controls and enter the network without being in close-proximity. Your organization should have a policy that prohibits personnel from connecting networking equipment without proper authorization. 

### Evil Twins

An Evil Twin is also a Rogue AP albeit they go one step further by spoofing a known-good AP. In addition to performing logical network scans to detect Rogue APs, ensure to physically inspect equipment on a routine basis.  

## Replay Attacks

Replay attacks are when the attacker sniffs the network, steals credentials, and uses them to gain access. Since the credentials are being presented again "as is" they are being _replayed_. Another closely-related concept is Pass-the-Hash \(PTH\). I cover PTH attacks in the section called, "Services & Applications."
