# Wireless Communications

In this section, I cover wireless communication and how attackers use this medium to achieve their objectives. 

## Amplification

To remain undetected, attackers will try to stay as far away as possible from their target. In the real-world, this could look like someone using binoculars. In cyberspace, this would look like someone beefing-up their hacking rig to include a high-powered antenna that can reach greater distances than a standard laptop or phone antenna. 

## Replay Attacks

Replay attacks are when the attacker sniffs the network, steals credentials, and uses them to gain access. Since the credentials being presented once more "as is" they are being _replayed_. Another closely-related concept is Pass-the-Hash \(PTH\). I cover PTH attacks in the section called, "Services & Applications."

## Jamming

## Disassociation

## Rogue APs

Attackers use Rogue APs \(Access Points\) in order to wirelessly extend the already-existing, wired network. The benefit of doing so allows them to bypass various network access controls and enter the network without being in close-proximity. Your organization should have a policy that prohibits personnel from connecting networking equipment without proper authorization. 

### Evil Twins

An Evil Twin is also a Rogue AP albeit they go one step further by spoofing a known-good AP. In addition to performing logical network scans to detect Rogue APs, ensure to physically inspect equipment on a routine basis.  

## Other Communication Methods

### WPS

### Bluetooth

#### Bluejacking

#### Bluesnarfing

### NFC

### RFID
