# Social Engineering

Social Engineering attacks target the vulnerability of people. It's human nature to be complacent, sympathetic, and/or trust the kindness of strangers. As a security professional, you must understand how bad guys take advantage of good people to achieve their objectives. Attackers often use Social Engineering to collect intelligence, gain access, or install malicious software. You should also know how to mitigate these attacks through cybersecurity awareness programs. If you want to change someone's behavior, increase their awareness. 

## Principles

Social Engineering attacks are successful because they use the following principles to take advantage of people: authority, intimidation, consensus, scarcity, familiarity, trust, and urgency. Below are examples for each. 

#### Authority

Calling someone for their password while impersonating an IT helpdesk clerk. 

#### Intimidation

Frightening someone into connecting a USB device to their computer.  

#### Consensus

Exchanging tickets to a football game for administrator privileges. 

#### Scarcity

Emailing someone a link and the promise of limited access to a vaccine if they click on it. 

#### Familiarity

Using common interests and kindness to collect intelligence from an employee about their organization. 

#### Trust

Leveraging an existing relationship to get someone to download unauthorized software. 

#### Urgency

Gaining physical access to a building after asking for directions to the bathroom. 

## Phishing

Phishing attacks are when someone uses technology to lure someone else into a trap or disclosing sensitive information. Attackers will often automate this process and spam thousands of people in hopes of getting at least a handful of victims. 

### Spear Phishing

Spear Phishing is when the attacker targets a specific person. For example, you were the target of a Spear Phishing attack if you ever got an bogus email that referenced unique things about you and your interests.  

### Whaling

Whaling is when the attacker targets a specific person because of their status or position. Imagine what would happen if the CEO of your organization was the victim of a Whaling attack. Do they have access to sensitive information that shouldn't be disclosed? 

### Vishing

Vishing is phishing over the phone. The attacker is using their voice, tone, and slang to be more convincing than an what they would be in a email. 

## Proximity-based Attacks

### Tailgating

### Shoulder Surfing

## Community-based Attacks

### Hoaxes
