# Social Engineering

Social Engineering attacks target the vulnerability of people. It's human nature to be complacent, sympathetic, and/or trust the kindness of strangers. As a security professional, you must understand how bad guys take advantage of good people to achieve their objectives. Attackers often use Social Engineering to collect intelligence, gain access, or install malicious software. You should also know how to mitigate these attacks through cybersecurity awareness programs. If you want to change someone's behavior, increase their awareness. 

### Principles

Social Engineering attacks are successful because they use the following principles to take advantage of people: authority, intimidation, consensus, scarcity, familiarity, trust, and urgency. Below are idioms and examples for each. 

#### Authority

Impersonating management, an IT helpdesk, or law enforcement.

Death threats. 

#### Consensus

Blackmail. Threatening to disclose a system administrator's extramarital affair unless they install malicious software.
