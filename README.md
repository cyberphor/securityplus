# Introduction

Hello world! My name is Victor Fernandez III. These are notes I have developed to help you prepare for the CompTIA Security+ certification. They also represent what I believe should be the baseline body of knowledge for junior cybersecurity professionals. Based on my experience in the field, I strongly recommend investing time learning Information Technology \(IT\) and networking fundamentals before diving into cybersecurity. If this recommendation speaks to you, I have another [digital notebook](https://itfplus.cyberphor.com) for the CompTIA IT Fundamentals certification.

## Before Getting Started

Before getting started, I recommend having a broad understanding of the topics below. They provide the backdrop for a lot of material in cybersecurity so spending the time to do a deep-dive on each will make your studying efforts go more smoothly. 

* Electromagnetic Spectrum
  * Copper \(volts\), radio \(signal\), fiber optic \(photons\) 
* Encapsulation
* Protocol Data Units
  * Segments
  * Packets
  * Frames
  * Bits
* TCP/IP
  * DNS
  * TCP, UDP
  * IP
  * IEEE 802.3 \(Wired Ethernet\), IEEE 802.11 \(Wireless Ethernet\), IEEE 802.15.1 \(Bluetooth\)
